Due to a misinterpretation of the format of the date from the tracking_data.txt,
the month and day are reversed in this program.

E.g. 05/07/2018 1:00:00 PM from tracking_data.txt

The date is actually May 7th 2018 however, I interpreted it as September 5th 2018.

For testing te use of this application please read the date format as dd/MM/yyyy.
Due to this misinterpretation there is much unnecessary code relating to date conversions.
